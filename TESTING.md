## Testing

Testing was carried out at every point in the development to check for issues with the code, responsiveness, design, interactivity and accessibility. The developer tools used primarily were Chrome DevTools, with the console and terminal playing a key factor in testing and debugging.

Each page has been inspected using google chrome developer tools and lighthouse Firefox inspector tool to ensure that each page is fully responsive on a variety of different screen sizes and devices. I also physicaly tested the webiste on the Iphone 12, Ipad air, Macbook and Pc computers.

## AUTOMATED TESTING

### Validation Results

* The W3C Markup Validator and the W3C CSS Validator were used to test and validate every all three pages of
the Tedoku interactive project to ensure that there were no syntax errors in the code. Chrome's
Lighthouse DevTool was also used to test for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO.
JSHint was used to test JavaScript code quality.

* The main info on html Validator thowing info messages on *Trailing slash on void elements* due to /> close tag being added automaticaly by *prettier* and manualy removing it will be added next time the file is saved.
